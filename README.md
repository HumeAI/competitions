# Hume AI | ML Competitions 

Large-scale human behavioral data is needed to accelerate human-centered AI research and provide benchmarks for the field. To address this need, Hume AI is working with researchers and organizations around the world to co-organize machine learning competitions using our novel datasets. Our upcoming competitions center on understanding emotional expression using multi-modal, multi-task, generative, and few-shot learning methods. 

Each competition will center on a new dataset capturing an understudied modality or context for human emotional behavior (e.g. voice, face, gesture, multi-modal, self-reported experience, social interaction). 

We welcome both academic and industry teams to participate.
