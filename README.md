# Hume AI | ML Competitions 

Large-scale human behavioral data is needed to accelerate human-centered AI research and provide benchmarks for the field. To address this need, Hume AI is working with researchers and organizations around the world to co-organize machine learning competitions using our novel datasets. Our upcoming competitions center on understanding emotional expression using multi-modal, multi-task, generative, and few-shot learning methods. 

Each competition will center on a new dataset capturing an understudied modality or context for human emotional behavior (e.g. voice, face, gesture, multi-modal, self-reported experience, social interaction). 

We welcome both academic and industry teams to participate.

- (Completed) See [ExVo2022](https://github.com/HumeAI/competitions/tree/main/ExVo2022) for the baseline code provided for the 2022 Expressive Vocalisations Competition held at ICML. The white paper describing those approaches can be found on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01780). 
- (Completed) See [A-VB](https://github.com/HumeAI/competitions/tree/main/A-VB2022) for the baseline code provided for the 2022 Affective Vocal Bursts Competition held at ACII. The white paper describing those approaches can be found on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03572).
